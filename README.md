# Snowplow Site Reliability Engineer Test

Congratulations on making it to this stage in the journey! The following skills test is designed to facilitate a technical conversation that we will schedule when you are complete. A perfect solution is not the goal here, this is really about understanding how you think through technical problems, address requirements, and how your personal style will complement our team. If you have any questions along the way, please do not hesitate to reach out!

## The main project: Consul Cluster on AWS

### Scenario

You have been tasked with setting up a redundant, distributed, and scalable Consul cluster on AWS. This cluster will be used in a production environment to provide distributed access to a key-value store for the ACME operations team. 

Your code submission will take the form of a Pull Request into this repo. The repository transfer should have added the Snowplower who invited you as a collaborator in the repo, but if you do not see anyone, please reach out and we will provide you with a username to invite. You are welcome to make a single PR to encompass the whole project. Feel free to squash your commits, but you are also welcome to showcase your journey and git etiquette! 

### Requirements
All infrastructure code should be submitted in the [./01-consul/](./01-consul/) directory. Please note, you are more than welcome to use existing open-source modules within this project rather than creating everything from scratch. Obviously, you are also welcome to show off a bit from if you have the time to spare, but starting with an existing recipe will not negatively impact your evaluation.

- [ ] The cluster must consist of 3 or more servers
- [ ] The servers must be distributed across 2 or more AWS availability zones
- [ ] The cluster nodes must survive reboots (Consul must automatically restart on server reboot and rejoin the cluster)
- [ ] The permanent loss of any server in the cluster must not result in a cluster failure or data loss
- [ ] The cluster must employ auto-discovery in that new servers being added are automatically clustered
- [ ] The latest version of Consul (1.15.x) should be used

### Non-functional Requirements

- All deployment must be done with code - there should be no manual interaction with the deployment of the cluster
- Deployment Automation must be implemented around this code - there should be no manual interaction to deploy the stack.
- Consider the scenarios that could result in downtime and ensure that they are accounted for:
    + Availability Zone going down
    + Server malfunction

As the infrastructure must be deployed from code you should utilize one of the popular provisioning tools available such as:
- Terraform
- CloudFormation

When implementing the CI/CD function you should utilize Github actions. This repository already has a .github directory for your convenience.

If you opt to automate this using another tool, please let us know which one you used ahead of the interview.

## FizzBuzz
In this small follow-up section, you will implement a version of the classic FizzBuzz problem in two scripting languages: bash and python. We have included the empty files [./02-fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.sh](./02-fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.sh) and [./02-fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.py](./02-fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.py) for your convenience.

**Bash**
- [ ] Write a bash script that stores in consul the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples
of 3 stores “Fizz” instead of the number and the multiples of 5 stores
“Buzz”. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five stores “FizzBuzz”

**Python**
- [ ] Write a python3 program that stores in consul the numbers from 101 to 200. For multiples
of 3 stores “Fizz” instead of the number and the multiples of 5 stores "FizzBuzz"

## Debugging

The [./03-debugging/](./03-debugging/) directory contains terraform that attempts to deploy a simple nginx cluster that responds "hello world" on port 80. But there are a few things wrong with it! Attempt to find out what is wrong and resolve each issue.

## What to bring along

You are expected to have started to prepare the templates / deployment code ahead of time so that we can jump straight into the deployment and so we can immediately start analyzing and testing the environment that is going to be spun up for the above requirements.

**Note:** You should smoke-test the deployment in your own AWS sub-account - the AWS free tier should more than cover your development needs. If you cannot access the AWS free tier please reach out and we will endeavor to find an alternative solution.
